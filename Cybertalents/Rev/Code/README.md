weekend-ctf//cybertalents//chellenge : 45M

this is a super easy challenge that giving us a simple assembly code 

check : 45M.asm

i tried to write a similar program in C from the assembly program

to make it readable for you check 54M.c

just compare the 54M.asm and my code 45M.c and you will understand the concept

for the solving script check 45M.py 
.

sorry guys that i don't play CTFs this couple month i am too busy but 

i will back soon as possible thanks for reading .
